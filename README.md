## Overview 
In this demo we can provide a relative path to TcHmi via the PLC in order to change a clickable link on the HMI.  This can be used to provide end users with a way to retrieve files created by TwinCAT.  

Files can only be served from inside the following directory. 
C:\ProgramData\Beckhoff\TF2000 TwinCAT 3 HMI Server\service\<<YourProjectName>>\www

## Getting Started
Activate and run the PLC project, then open Desktop.view in live view using a browser.  The built-in live view will not support downloads. 

## Code Snippet
```javascript
function CreateDownloadLink(TargetHtmlHost, FileRelativePath) {

    var html = '<a href=\"' + FileRelativePath + '\" download=\"\">My Download Link </a>';
    TargetHtmlHost.setContent(html);

}
```

## Versions
